          # GHSA-3749-ghw9-m3mg and GHSA-887c-mr87-cxwp are pytorch vulnerabilities that have no fix yet
          # GHSA-53q9-r3pm-6pq6 is a pytorch vulnerability that has a fix in 2.6.0 which we can't upgrade to just yet
          # PYSEC-2024-109 requires upgrading to DeepSpeed 0.15.1, which is currently blocked by pycyclops
          # PYSEC-2025-61 requires upgrading to Pillow 11.3.0}, which is currently blocked by pycyclops
          # PYSEC-2024-259 has note that this is disputed by multiple parties because this is intended PyTorch behaviour
          # GHSA-2c2j-9gv5-cj73 is a starlette vulnerability that requires 0.47.2, but FastAPI cannot support moving to this yet.
