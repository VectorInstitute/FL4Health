# Code for running experiments

We have 3-DP setups: central, distributed, local. Each setup has 4 experiments from FLamby. These experiments can be run from master file `secure_aggregation_run_script.sh`. Make sure ports do not conflict when running multiplie experiments, otherwise one gets dimension mismatch errors.
