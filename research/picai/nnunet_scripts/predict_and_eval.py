    Runs prediction and evaluation pipeline for nnunet models. First runs
    inference for one or more models and nnunet configs. Converts the model
    output logits to probabilities, then ensembles the probabilities and
    computes the predicted annotations. It also derives detection maps from
    the ensembled probabilities and computes the official PICAI metrics from
    using the picai_eval API from the detection maps.

    Args:
        config_path (str): Path to a yaml config file. The three required keys
            are plans, dataset_json and one or more nnunet_configs (eg. 2d,
            3d_fullres etc.). The nnunet config keys should contain a list of
            paths. If the path points to a file it should be a model
            checkpoint. The model checkpoints can be dicts with the
            'network_weights' key or nn.Modules. If the path points to a
            directory it should be an nnunet results folder for a particular
            dataset-config-trainer combo. The plans key should be the path to
            the nnunet model plans json file. The dataset_json key should be
            the path to the dataset json of one of the training datasets. Or
            create a new json yourself with the 'label' and 'file_ending' keys
            and their corresponding values as specified by nnunet.
        input_folder (str): Path to the folder containing the raw input data
            that has not been processed by nnunet yet. File names must follow
            the nnunet convention where each channel modality is stored as a
            separate file. File names should be case-identifier_0000 where
            0000 is a 4 digit integer representing the channel/modality. All
            cases must have the same N channels numbered from 0 to N.
        label_folder (str): Path to the folder containing the ground truth
            annotation maps. File names must match the case identifiers of the
            input images
        output_folder (str): Path to the output folder. By default this script
            will save the predicted probabilities, detection maps and
            annotations.
