class MultiAttributeEnum(Enum):
    def __init__(self, attributes: Any) -> None:
        """
        A subclass of Enum that allows members to have multiple attributes.
        Members can be defined by either dictionaries or lists. The attributes
        of the members must also be defined in the subclass to avoid mypy issues
        Example Usage:
            Animals(MultiAttributeEnum):
                # Define Attributes
                species: str
                mammal: bool
                height: float
                # Define Members
                Dog = {'species': 'Canis Lupus Familiaris', 'mammal': True, 'height': 0.5}
                Giraffe = {'species': 'Giraffa', 'mammal': True, 'height': 10}

        By default the main attribute is the first value in the dictionary. So
        for the above example:

        >>> Animals('Canis Lupus Familiaris')
        Animals.Dog

        The main attribute can be changed by overriding
        self.get_main_value(). If the value of the main attribute is not
        unique to a specific member, then the member that was defined first is
        returned.

        Members can also be defined using lists so long as the
        self.get_attribute_keys() method is also defined by the user.
        Additionally, not all members need to have all the attributes. This is
        also true when the members are defined using dictionaries. You can even
        mix dictionaries and lists.
        Example Usage:
            Animals(MultiAttributeEnum):
                # Define Attributes
                species: str
                mammal: bool

                attribute values for the enum member. If a list is given then
