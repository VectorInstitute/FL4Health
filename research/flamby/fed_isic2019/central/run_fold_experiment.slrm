# Usage:
#
# sbatch research/flamby/fed_isic2019/central/run_fold_experiment.slrm \
#   path_to_folder_for_artifacts/ \
#   path_to_folder_for_dataset/ \
#   path_to_desired_venv/
#
# Example:
# sbatch research/flamby/fed_isic2019/central/run_fold_experiment.slrm \
#   research/flamby/fed_isic2019/central/results/ \
#   /Users/david/Desktop/FLambyDatasets/fedisic2019/ \
#   /h/demerson/vector_repositories/fl4health_env/
#
# Notes:
# 1) The sbatch command above should be run from the top level directory of the repository.
# 2) This example runs centralized dataset training. As such the data paths and python launch commands are hardcoded.
# If you want to change the example you run, you need to explicitly modify the code below.
# 3) The logging directories need to ALREADY EXIST. The script does not create them.
