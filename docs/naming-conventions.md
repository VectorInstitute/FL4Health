# Naming Conventions 

1. Folder containing the privacy mechanism is called `./dp-mechanisms`

2. Python files that contain the mechanism begin with `dp*` such as `dpSkellam.py` so all the mechanisms are grouped together.

3. The mechanism end with `*Mechanism` and follow Pascal case such as `DiscreteGaussianMechanism`.

4. To distinguish server/client side functions we use the convention `PoissonBinomialMechanism_Client`.
