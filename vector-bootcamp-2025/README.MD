## Welcome to the 2025 Vector FL Bootcamp!

This folder contains several guides to help as you learn the library and work on your federated learning use-cases.
You can view the guides as markdown files in this folder under `vector-bootcamp-2025/src/`. However, these guides are
also rendered together and hosted at the https://vectorinstitute.github.io/bootcamp-fl-2025/.

We look forward to working with you!
