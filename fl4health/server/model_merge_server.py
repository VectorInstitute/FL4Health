            strategy (Optional[Strategy], optional): The aggregation strategy to be used by the server to handle
                client updates sent by the participating clients. Must be ModelMergeStrategy.

                server side checkpointing on the merged model. If none, then no server-side checkpointing is

                server side checkpointing. Must only be provided if checkpointer is also provided. Defaults to None.

            metrics_reporter (Optional[MetricsReporter], optional): A metrics reporter instance to record the metrics
                during the execution. Defaults to an instance of MetricsReporter with default init parameters.
