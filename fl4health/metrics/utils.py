    Infers the label dimension given two related tensors of different shapes.

    Generally useful for inferring the label dimension when one tensor is vector-encoded and the other is not. The
    label dimension is inferred by looking for dimensions that either are not the same size, or are not present in
    tensor 2.

    Args:
        tensor1 (torch.Tensor): The reference tensor. Must have the same number of dimensions as tensor 2, or have
            exactly 1 more dimension (the label dim).

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If the the label dimension cannot be inferred without ambiguity. For example if a dimension
            next to the label dimension has the same size.

    If necessary, attempts to correct shape mismatches between the given tensors by inferring which one
    to one-hot-encode. Note that if both preds and targets have the same shape then nothing needs to be modified. If
    there is a mismatch, it is assumed that the labels in one of the predictions or the targets are vector encoded
    in some way (either one-hot or soft) while the other is label index encoded.

    If one is vector encoded but not the other, then both are returned as vector encoded tensors.

    hold in binary classification settings where continuous values might be used to indicate the positive label by
    default. As such, this function should not be used for those types of tensors.
