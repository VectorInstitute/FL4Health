    Given a set of count tensors representing true positives (TP), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN),
    compute the  Dice score as 2*TP/(2*TP + FP + FN) ELEMENTWISE. The zero division argument determines how to deal
    with examples with all true negatives, which implies that TP + FP + FN = 0 and an undefined value.

    Args:
        true_positives (torch.Tensor): count of true positives in each entry
        false_positives (torch.Tensor): count of false positives in each entry
        false_negatives (torch.Tensor): count of false negatives in each entry
        zero_division (float | None): How to deal with zero division. If None, the values with zero division are
            simply dropped. If a float is specified, this value is injected into each Dice score that would have
            been undefined.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Dice scores computed for each element in the TP, FP, FN tensors computed ELEMENTWISE with
            replacement or dropping of undefined entries. The tensor returned is flattened to be 1D.
