        https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320323002078. The approach attempts to manipulate the
        training dynamics of a parallel weight split model with a global feature extractor, that is aggregated
        on the server-side with FedAvg and a local feature extractor that is only locally trained. This method is
        related to FENDA, but with additional losses on the latent spaces of the local and global feature extractors.
