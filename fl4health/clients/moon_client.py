        This client implements the MOON algorithm from Model-Contrastive Federated Learning. The key idea of MOON is
        to enforce similarity between representations from the global and current local model through a contrastive
        loss to constrain the local training of individual parties in the non-IID setting.

        Args:
            data_path (Path): path to the data to be used to load the data for client-side training
            metrics (Sequence[Metric]): Metrics to be computed based on the labels and predictions of the client model
            device (torch.device): Device indicator for where to send the model, batches, labels etc. Often 'cpu' or
                'cuda'
            loss_meter_type (LossMeterType, optional): Type of meter used to track and compute the losses over
                each batch. Defaults to LossMeterType.AVERAGE.
            checkpoint_and_state_module (ClientCheckpointAndStateModule | None, optional): A module meant to handle
                both checkpointing and state saving. The module, and its underlying model and state checkpointing
                components will determine when and how to do checkpointing during client-side training.
                No checkpointing (state or model) is done if not provided. Defaults to None.
            reporters (Sequence[BaseReporter] | None, optional): A sequence of FL4Health reporters which the client
                should send data to. Defaults to None.
            progress_bar (bool, optional): Whether or not to display a progress bar during client training and
                validation. Uses tqdm. Defaults to False
            client_name (str | None, optional): An optional client name that uniquely identifies a client.
                If not passed, a hash is randomly generated. Client state will use this as part of its state file
                name. Defaults to None.
            temperature (float, optional): Temperature used in the calculation of the contrastive loss.
                Defaults to 0.5.
            contrastive_weight (float, optional): Weight placed on the contrastive loss function. Referred to as mu
                in the original paper. Defaults to 1.0.
            len_old_models_buffer (int, optional): Number of old models to be stored for computation in the
                contrastive learning loss function. Defaults to 1.
