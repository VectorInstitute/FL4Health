# Naming Conventions

1. Folder containing the privacy mechanism is called `fl4health/privacy_mechanisms`

2. Python files that contain the mechanism begin with `dp*` such as `dpSkellam.py` so all the mechanisms are grouped together.

3. The mechanism end with `*Mechanism` and follow Pascal case such as `discrete_gaussian_mechanism`.

4. To distinguish server/client side functions we use the convention `poisson_binomial_client`.
