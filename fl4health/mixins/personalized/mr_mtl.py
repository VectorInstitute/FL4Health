        This client implements the MR-MTL algorithm from MR-MTL: On Privacy and Personalization in Cross-Silo
        Federated Learning. The idea is that we want to train personalized versions of the global model for each
        client. However, instead of using a separate solver for the global model, as in Ditto, we update the initial
        global model with aggregated local models on the server-side and use those weights to also constrain the
        training of a local model. The constraint for this local model is identical to the FedProx loss. The key
        difference is that the local model is never replaced with aggregated weights. It is always local.

        **NOTE**: lambda, the drift loss weight, is initially set and potentially adapted by the server akin to the
        heuristic suggested in the original FedProx paper. Adaptation is optional and can be disabled in the
        corresponding strategy used by the server
