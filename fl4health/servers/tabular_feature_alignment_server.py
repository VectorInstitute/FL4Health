        This server is used when the clients all have tabular data that needs to be aligned.

        Args:
            client_manager (ClientManager): Determines the mechanism by which clients are sampled by the server, if
                they are to be sampled at all.
            config (Config): This should be the configuration that was used to setup the federated alignment.
                In most cases it should be the "source of truth" for how FL alignment should proceed.

                **NOTE:** This config is **DISTINCT** from the Flwr server config, which is extremely minimal.
            initialize_parameters (Callable[[int, int], Parameters]): Function used to initialize the model to be
                trained and used for the tabular task.

                **NOTE**: The model architecture is not finalized until we are able to determine the dimensionality of
                the input and output space during feature alignment.
            strategy (BasicFedAvg): The aggregation strategy to be used by the server to handle.
                client updates and other information potentially sent by the participating clients. If None the
                strategy is FedAvg as set by the flwr Server.
            tabular_features_source_of_truth (TabularFeaturesInfoEncoder | None, optional): The information that is
                required for aligning client features. If it is not specified, then the server will randomly poll a
                client and gather this information from its data source. Defaults to None.
            reporters (Sequence[BaseReporter] | None, optional): Sequence of FL4Health reporters which the server
                should send data to before and after each round. Defaults to None
            checkpoint_and_state_module (BaseServerCheckpointAndStateModule | None, optional): This module is used
                to handle both model checkpointing and state checkpointing. The former is aimed at saving model
                artifacts to be used or evaluated after training. The latter is used to preserve training state
                (including models) such that if FL training is interrupted, the process may be restarted. If no
                module is provided, no checkpointing or state preservation will happen. Defaults to None.
            on_init_parameters_config_fn (Callable[[int], dict[str, Scalar]] | None, optional): Function used to
                configure how one asks a client to provide parameters from which to initialize all other clients by
                providing a ``Config`` dictionary. If this is none, then a blank config is sent with the parameter
                request (which is default behavior for flower servers). Defaults to None.
            server_name (str | None, optional): An optional string name to uniquely identify server. This name is also
                used as part of any state checkpointing done by the server. Defaults to None.
            accept_failures (bool, optional): Determines whether the server should accept failures during training or
                evaluation from clients or not. If set to False, this will cause the server to shutdown all clients
                and throw an exception. Defaults to True.
